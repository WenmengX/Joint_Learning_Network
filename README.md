## JointNet
A python implementation of "JointNet: Joint learning for simultaneous DOA estimation and speech enhancement in noisy and reverberant environments" Paper accepted by TASLP 2026.

+ **Contributions** 
End to end multi-task models for simultaneous DOA estimation and speech enhancement. The models incorporate the SOTA methods in DOA estimation and speech enhancement and achieve performance 
improvement for both tasks using interaction blocks.
